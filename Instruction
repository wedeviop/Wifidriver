Hi friend... I have solved the issue. First to solves the touchpad problem I need to upgrade my kernel to 4.13.4, I have make it using the "sudo ukuu --install v4.13.4", next reboot the touchpad works... After that i saw that my wireless doesn't works well, so I do that:

 

1 - check if your wireless adapter is that one: "Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. RTL8821AE 802.11ac PCIe Wireless Network Adapter", use this command: lspci | grep Wireless

2 - sudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic build-essential git

3 - git clone http://github.com/lwfinger/rtlwifi_new.git

4 - cd rtlwifi_new

5 - make

6 - sudo make install

7 - sudo modprobe rtl8821ae

8 - reboot your system

9 - Enjoy =D
